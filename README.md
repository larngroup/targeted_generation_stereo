# Artificial Intelligence for Prediction of Biological Activities and Generation of molecular hits using Stereochemical Information

<p align="justify"> In this work, we develop a method for generating targeted hit compounds by applying deep reinforcement learning and attention mechanisms to predict binding affinity against a biological target while considering stereochemical information. We demonstrated the importance of attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in molecular sequences. Due to the importance of stereochemical information for the binding mechanism, this information was employed both in the prediction and generation processes. To identify the most promising hits, we apply the self-adaptive multi-objective optimization strategy. Moreover, to ensure the existence of stereochemical information, we consider all the possible enumerated stereoisomers to provide the most appropriate 3D structures. We evaluated this approach against the Ubiquitin-Specific Protease 7 (USP7) by generating
putative inhibitors for this target. Our methodology identify the regions of
the generated molecules that are important for the interaction with the receptorâ€™s
active site. Also, the obtained results demonstrate that it is possible to discover
synthesizable molecules with high biological affinity for the target, containing the
indication of their optimal stereochemical conformation. </p>
